We're bringing you weekly CTF challenges to help you sharpen your skills from the ground up. Whether you're a newbie or a h4x0r, these challenges are a great way to practice and improve your problem-solving abilities in a fun and engaging way.

Every week, we'll post a new challenge in the **#weekly-challenges** channel. These challenges will *(probably)* change every week, but sometimes we might extend the retirement date to give you a bit more time to crack them, but generally, expect a fresh challenge each week to keep things interesting.

Here's what we have in mind: New challenges will be posted every Monday and retired on Friday at 23:59:59 (GMT+7). On Sunday evening, we'll have a discussion on how to solve the challenge. We strongly encourage you to share your write-ups on the `#forum` *(tags: ctf)*. We'll select the best articles to highlight and discuss further.

To submit a flag, simply use the slash command `/submit` on the Discord server. If you encounter any error messages, just ignore them and try submitting again. Persistence is key!

## ‚úçüèª Notes

* The difficulty level of each challenge is based on the points you can earn. The tougher the challenge, the more points it's worth!
* Flags submitted after the retirement date won't be counted, so be sure to get your flags in on time.
* Sharing the flag with others is strictly prohibited. If you're caught doing this, your account will be banned from the Discord server. Let's keep the competition fair and fun for everyone!

If you have any ideas for new challenges or if you'd like to create a challenge yourself, please reach out to **@bin**. We're always open to suggestions and contributions from everyone.
