## Steps to Resolve

With a simple entry point code, to print `cs.flag` (which is set to the constant `o`), the value of `(new Date).getTime()` minus the constant `n` (when it was initialized) needs to be at least **5** (milliseconds). Between these times, there's the initialization of the constant `o` and a call to the `test()` method of RegExp instances (`re`). Looking at the pattern, it's vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial-of-Service (ReDoS) because it has nested quantifiers `([\w-]+)*`. This group matches zero or more alphanumeric chars, underscores, or hyphens, and the `*` quantifier is especially problematic because it allows for zero or more matches. When combined with other quantifiers, it can cause the regex engine to enter catastrophic backtracking.

Here is a visualization of the pattern to show you better: `https://regexper.com/#%2F%5Ehttps%3F%3A%5C%2F%5C%2F%28www%5C.%29%3F%28%5Ba-z0-9-%5D%2B%29%5C.%5Ba-z%5D%7B2%2C%7D%5C%2F%28%5B%5Cw-%5D%2B%29*%24%2F`.

So, all we need to do is input a string with repeated sequences of characters that match group #3 to slow things down.

```bash
$ /path/to/sabar <<< 'http://x.com/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/'
